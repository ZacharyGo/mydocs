 * From codewars. Jumping Number
 * 
 * Jumping number is the number that All adjacent digits in it differ by 1.
 * Given a number, Find if it is Jumping or not .
 * 
 * Number passed is always Positive . Return the result as String . The
 * difference between e9f and e0f is not considered as 1 . All single digit
 * numbers are considered as Jumping numbers.
 * 
 * jumpingNumber(9) ==> return "Jumping!!" It's single-digit number
 * 
 * jumpingNumber(79) ==> return "Not!!" Adjacent digits don't differ by 1
 * 
 * jumpingNumber(23) ==> return "Jumping!!" Adjacent digits differ by 1
 * 
 * jumpingNumber(556847) ==> return "Not!!" Adjacent digits don't differ by 1
 * 
 * jumpingNumber(4343456) ==> return "Jumping!!" Adjacent digits differ by 1
 * 
 * jumpingNumber(89098) ==> return "Not!!" Adjacent digits don't differ by 1
