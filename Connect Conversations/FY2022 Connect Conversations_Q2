When there are QAs that took more than 5 days for FJ to response, I should have request to put the ticket on hold rather waiting for it to be answered.
I should have ask help from my teammates when I am stuck on a task.
I should improve my communication skills more like practicing Tagalog more for easier to understand between discussion with teammates.
